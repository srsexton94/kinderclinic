# KinderClinic

A simple patient registration and scheduling app built in React (initialized with Vite).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. View a list of their children (the patients).

- Display each child’s name, age, and whether they have an upcoming
  appointment.

2. Submit a form to add a new child to the list.

- It should capture at least these fields: first name, last name, sex, and date of birth.
- After submitting the form, the newly added child should appear in the list.

3. Schedule an appointment for their child.

- The user can click somewhere to schedule an appointment for any of their
  children.
- Assume we have infinite availability, so we simply need the parent to provide a
  date, time, and purpose of their visit (“well visit” or “sick visit”).
- Once scheduled, the appointment info should be shown somewhere.
